# Biteback (A Course Project for the University of Virginia)

## My Responsibilities

### I was the Requirements Manager for this product development team. I handled the requirement elicitation process, created the GitHub issues, and generated requirements needed to produce a final project that meets the needs of the potential users.

### On the code side, I helped implement the functionality of the site by creating the following features:
- uploading profile pictures from google login information
- admin capability of updating the status of a post
- textboxes for unique resolution messages
- restaurant information using Google Places API
